Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Learn as much as you can about sports.</h3>
              <p>Most sports analysts start off as sports fans. Once you’ve decided to pursue a career as a sportscaster, absorb as much knowledge about sports as you can. 
                Keep up with collegiate as well as professional teams, and follow multiple sports rather than just one or two. A good sports analyst is expected to be like a walking encyclopedia of sports information.</p>
              <p>It is not enough to know all about one team, or even one sport. 
                Sports analysts have to possess a thorough knowledge of all the most sports, including football, basketball, baseball, soccer, hockey, golf, boxing and even Olympic and extreme sports.</p>

              <h3>Earn an undergraduate degree in a related field.</h3>
              <p>Go to school and work towards a degree in journalism, communications or broadcasting. 
                While it’s not strictly necessary to have one of these degrees in order to land a job in sports journalism, most employers prefer that applicants hold a bachelor’s degree or higher. 
                Online programs are also available for those who are unable to attend university classes. </p>
              <p>Holding a degree, along with the right experience, can give you an advantage over those without an education when it comes to getting hired. </p>
              <p>Many online programs can be completed in less time than a full term at a university, and include all the most relevant courses, such as news reporting, media ethics, sports psychology and broadcasting.</p>

              <p>Attend sporting events regularly and meet as many industry professionals as you can. See if you can take up a minute of the coach’s time, or ask a sports reporter or even a camera technician how they broke into the business. 
                Give your name to everyone you meet and let them know that you’re interested in getting started as a sportscaster. This way, they’ll remember you once it comes time to put your networking to use. </p>

              <p>Don’t be shy about asking for advice. Most sports reporters are very comfortable talking to people and will be happy to share the secrets of their success with you.</p>

              <h3>Get comfortable being on the radio or TV.</h3>
              <p>While some sports analysts are confined to offices researching and writing reports, others will find themselves presenting these reports to the masses on the air. 
                If you intend to advance into broadcast journalism, you’ll need to cultivate a distinct professional demeanor and be at ease working in front of the cameras. 
                Learn to think on your feet and stay poised and you’ll quickly get over the nerves of appearing in broadcasts. </p> 
              <p>Talking for the radio or TV cameras can be intimidating, but will become easier the more you do it. </p>
              <p>It may also be a good idea to know how to work with teleprompters, research databases, word processing programs and other technology utilized by professionals.</p>

                player trades and injuries and team personnel changes. Your reputation depends on your ability to keep up with all types of sports-related information at once. Luckily, this is the most rewarding part of working as a sports analyst—getting
